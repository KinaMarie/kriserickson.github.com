Every now and then when a technical person tries [Recipe Folder](https://recipe-folder.com) out, I get asked about how the application was built and what it runs on.  It is kind of an interesting application in that it has quite a few moving pieces.  It has a website, a backend api, a Bookmerklet or Browser extension as well as a mobile application that accesses API services on the backend.  It is also kind of interesting as it was a chance for a greenfield application where I could choose any technology, and it was built knowing that it was a pretty niche market and not going to have a ton of traffic and really never be able to make money (the dream is that one day it pays for its own hosting).  I built the app for myself as something I wanted, and I knew it was always going to be something that a couple of hours a week was spent on and I would never have the time or inclination to work on it full time.  I also built it to spend some time with technologies that I was unfamiliar with, and learn about them in a no-risk environment.

So, I chose to write the backend and website in Node.js, using Express with MongoDB being the data store.  The app was started before Angular came into vogue, so it was not built with Angular, though one my [Trello](https://trello.com) board there is a task to spend a few hours rewrite the mess that is the Admin interface in [Angular 2](https://angular.io/) to see how that differs from Angular, or I may go with [React](http://facebook.github.io/react/) or [Aurelia](http://aurelia.io/) to try something new.  [Express](http://expressjs.com/) has been a joy to use to quickly bang out a website and backend API, especially when used with [Mongo](http://www.mongodb.org/) and [Mongoose](http://mongoosejs.com/).   I use [MongoLab](http://www.mongodb.org/) to host Mongo, for a few reasons: initially I was running the whole backend off of a $3 a month Nodejitsu (more on that later) as I wanted to see what running on a PAAS was like.  Since I was going with a PAAS for the website, I was forced to run on MongoLab a Database as a Service.  Running on MongoLab also freed me from the concerns I had heard about MongoDB databases randomly losing all my data, as MongoLab would be in charge of that (though I do still download a backup of my database once a day through a cron script).  Even though MongoLab is now (initially it was in the same Colo) in a different state than my VPS I have had no speed issue, and it is mostly the fact that I may will eventually grow out of the free database that motivates me to start running my own mongo server (though I have quite a while of huge growth that would be required before I actually have to move).
 
 I switched off Nodejitsu (no link because they are owned by GoDaddy now, and I refuse to link to anything about GoDaddy) because they increased their prices from $3 a month to $9 and then went through a series of failures where the website would go down for days a time.  They also had no way to have a TLS site that used your domain name (you got a nodejitsu.com domain, which was ok for web services, but hardly an optimal situation.  I switched from Nodejitsu to a VPS on [Digital Ocean](https://www.digitalocean.com/), which I have been very happy with.  While I do miss the old deployment method of Nodejitsu, though I haven't missed it enough to switch to [Capistrano](http://capistranorb.com/), or [Ship-It](https://github.com/shipitjs/grunt-shipit) or [FlightPlan](https://github.com/pstadler/flightplan).  Currently my deployment method is a collection of custom grunt tasks, but I am thinking of switching to [FlightPlan](https://github.com/pstadler/flightplan) at some point.
