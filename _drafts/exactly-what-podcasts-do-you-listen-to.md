As my wife will tell you (he's always got bloody headphones in his ears), I am a voracious podcast listener.  The only
thing that keeps my sane on my commutes, doing the dishes, cleaning the house, or any other number of chores is
listening to podcasts.   One of the first things I had to do when switching to android is find a decent podcast
app (it's [Pocket Casts](http://www.shiftyjelly.com/pocketcasts) btw, and [Downcast](http://www.downcastapp.com/) on IOS.
 Though I might give Pocket Casts a try on IOS, as its refresh is speed is truly amazing (they cache all the feeds on
 their servers so it is very fast to update your list of podcasts, a serious issue if you follow 30 or so podcasts like I do).
 Several people have asked me what I subscribe to, so here is my current list of podcasts with a little description and
 why I listen to it:

 Tech Podcasts
 =============
      [Daily Tech News Show](http://feeds.feedburner.com/DailyTechNewsShow) - I used to listen to [Buzz Out Loud](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buzz_Out_Loud) years ago, and
      then followed [Tom Merrit](http://www.tommerritt.com/) to [Tech News Today](http://twit.tv/tnt).  When he was let
      go last month I switched to his new podcast, the temporarily (one hopes) named [Daily Tech News Show](http://www.dailytechnewsshow.com/).

      [The News](HTTP://feeds.5by5.tv/news) - 5 minutes of tech news daily.  Fast, sometimes reports something I missed.

      [Windows Weekly (MP3)](http://leoville.tv/podcasts/ww.xml) - [Paul Thurrott](http://winsupersite.com/) is so frequently wrong and yet I
       kind of can't stop listening to him.  [Mary Jo Foley](http://www.zdnet.com/blog/microsoft/) probably knows more about Microsoft than any
       non-techy I know.  I find the show interesting, and it is kind of a chronicle of Microsofts downfall.

      [What The Tech](http://feeds.feedburner.com/Whatthetechgfq) - More Paul Thorrott, because I can't seem to get enough.

      [This Week in Startups - Audio](http://feeds.feedburner.com/twist-audio) - [Jason Calacanis](http://calacanis.com/) is a
      divisive figure, some people love him, lots of people hate him.  A tireless self-promoter who frequently has a lot
      of insight into the entrepreneurial world and often has excellent guests.  His sometimes weekly round tables with
      silicon valley reports has replaced [This Week in Tech](http://twit.tv/twit)(which has truly become a snoozefest)
      as my weekly wrap of Tech Events.

      [This Developer's Life](http://feeds.feedburner.com/ThisDevelopersLife) - Seems this show has gone semi-annual, but
      it is a fantastic show when they actually get around to producing one.  Stories about Developers similar to this
      American Life and the way it does shows about Americans (North Americans?  Westerners?)  A product of [Scott Hansleman](http://www.hanselman.com/)
      and [Rob Connery](http://www.wekeroad.com/) it is highly recommended.

      [The Web Ahead](http://feeds.5by5.tv/webahead) - In depth show on Web Technologies from a designers standpoint.

      [.NET Rocks!](http://feeds.feedburner.com/dotnetrocks) - I was (and I guess still am) a C# developer for years and
      this is the show for the Microsoft Developer.  I frequently skip episodes now, depending on the guest and the
      subject matter, but frequently they have some truly great interviews.  Don't miss their Geek Out Shows when they
      discuss basic Geek Out things like Self Driving Cars or Solar Energy or BBQ.

      [The Tablet Show](http://www.pwop.com/feed.aspx?show=thetabletshow&amp;filetype=master) - The sister show to .NET Rocks,
      but all about Mobile devices (Phones and Tablets).  Much less Microsoft based, but still with a bit of a Microsoft bias.

      [The Changelog](http://feeds.5by5.tv/changelog) - Interviews with Open Source project leaders and developers.  Can be
       fascinating, can be boring (really depends upon the guest).

      [Javascript Jabber](http://feeds.feedburner.com/JavascriptJabber) - Javscript is where I do most of my work these days,
       and this is best podcast about Javascript I have found.

      [Herding Code](http://feeds.feedburner.com/herdingcode) - Initially a Microsoft podcast it has branched out a bit (though
       it appears to have been basically taken over by [Jon Galloway](http://weblogs.asp.net/jgalloway) who does work
       at Microsoft, and though I would hardly call him a Microsoft Shill it does tend to focus on Microsoft technologies
       more often than not.

      [Hanselminutes](http://feeds.feedburner.com/Hanselminutes) - Another Microsoftie [Scott Hanselman](http://www.hanselman.com/)
       has been doing a podcast since long before he joined Microsoft.  His podcast features interviews with people all over
       the map, from Microsoft employees he works with,

      [Security Now (MP3)](http://leoville.tv/podcasts/sn.xml) - Security news and a lot of filler

      [Developing Perspective](http://developingperspective.com/feed/podcast/) - 

      
      
      [Washington Week Podcast | PBS](http://feeds.pbs.org/pbs/weta/washingtonweek-audio) - 
      [Slate's Political Gabfest](http://feeds.feedburner.com/SlatePoliticalGabfest) - 
      [NPR: Planet Money Podcast](http://www.npr.org/rss/podcast.php?id=510289) - 
      [New Yorker: The Political Scene](http://feeds.newyorker.com/services/rss/feeds/campaign_trail.xml) - 
      [Common Sense with Dan Carlin](http://feeds.feedburner.com/dancarlin/commonsense?format=xml) -
