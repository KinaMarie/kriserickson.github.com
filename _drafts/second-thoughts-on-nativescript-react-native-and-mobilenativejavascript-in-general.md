It's been 6 months since I wrote [First Thoughts on NativeScript](http://www.agingcoder.com/programming/2015/03/07/first-thoughts-on-nativescript/)
and you would think by now with my formidable blogging output I would have written dozens of articles following up on 
my initial thoughts.  Well, as they say the best laid plans of mice and men, but I finally spent several hours with
the latest build NativeScript build ([NativeScript 1.3](https://www.nativescript.org/blog/details/nativescript-1.3-release-is-live)
and I thought I would pass on my thoughts of how NativeScript progressing and my ongoing thoughts of NativeScript,
[React Native](https://facebook.github.io/react-native/), [Titanium](http://www.appcelerator.com/titanium/),
[TabrisJs](https://tabrisjs.com/) and what I am now dubbing the "MobileNativeJavaScript" movement (I know the MNJS name
is going to catch on and rock the world!)
