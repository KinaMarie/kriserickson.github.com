I bought a Nexus 4 at the end of August when they dropped to $199.  My iPhone 4 was barely holding on and I had grown
frustrated with Apple's walled garden for the past few years.  A month later even though I quite liked the Nexus 4
I upgraded to the Nexus 5, here are my thoughts on that switch:

The iPhone was amazing when it came out, truly amazing.  It had a almost a five year lead on the competition, however
it seemed like because of the initial work done, IOS upgrades were very incremental (at least until IOS 7).  From the
beginning Apple was very tied to its walled garden (or benevolent caretaker) approach, in that you were stuck Apple's
poorer quality apps.  It has kind of amazed me that although Apple apps where initially best of breed, Google and other
companies had been creating the best Apps on IOS for a while, and those Apps were hobbled because there was no way
of setting them as the default handler for basic things like Mail, Maps, and Web Browsing.  I probably would have stuck
with IOS if they had changed that one thing in IOS7, the ability to register other Apps as the default app.  In my last
couple of years on IOS I had switched to Google Maps as my default Maps, Chrome as my default browser, (I still used
the Mail app because it was still superior to everything else out there).  Every time I clicked on a link that opened up
Safari or the Apple maps and I had to copy the url or location and re-open it in my environment of choice made the
switch more inevitable.

And then there was the Nexus 7, the cheap little tablet that convinced me that Android was not as bad as I remembered
from the 2.3 Gingerbread era.  There were slowly starting to be quality apps made for Android, and some apps on Android
were even better than the equivalent on IOS.  I truly believe that the Nexus 7 and a couple of other inexpensive quality
tablets were the reason that a lot of technical people realized that Android was finally getting to a point where it
was as polished as IOS and that the state of Apps was really improving.

<blockquote>***Digression*** It's not the number of Apps that are on a platform, it's having the apps that you need/want
and the quality of those apps.   There are almost 150,000 apps in the Windows 8 store and when I first started using Windows 8
I literally could not find one that I wanted to use.  I really
wanted to try the Windows 8 experience and I downloaded apps that I had been told where of excellent quality and I never used
any of them more than 1 minute of trying them out.   Netflix and Kindle were actually better in a browser, and the rest had no
compelling to use them.
</blockquote>


 and then it kind of stagnated for years.  Whereas Android was kind of a mess when
initially appeared and over the past few years has become the equal or better of IOS.

- Until quite recently iPhone build quality was superior to all of the android phones, which maintained had remained plastic
and not copied the metal finishing of the iPhone 4.  In devices like the HTC One and Nexus 5 the build quality was finally
 at parity with what apple had achieved and with the Nexus 5 at a considerable savings to the iPhone (almost half the price).
