I bought a Nexus 4 at the end of August when they dropped to $199.  My iPhone 4 was barely holding on and I had grown
frustrated with Apple's closed garden for the past few years.  A month later even though I quite liked the Nexus 4
I upgraded to the Nexus 5, here are my thoughts on that switch:

- The iPhone was amazing when it came out and then it kind of stagnated for years.  Whereas Android was kind of a mess when
initially appeared and over the past few years has become the equal or better of IOS.

- Until quite recently iPhone build quality was superior to all of the android phones, which maintained had remained plastic
and not copied the metal finishing of the iPhone 4.  In devices like the HTC One and Nexus 5 the build quality was finally
 at parity with what apple had achieved and with the Nexus 5 at a considerable savings to the iPhone (almost half the price).
