When mentoring a new programmer I almost always try to force them to learn two things, Regular Expressions and VIM.  Although both are relics
of a bi-gone era (I still think it is hilarious though cyclical VIM popularity is, I expect EMACS to swing back into vogue any day now) I still
use each one every day, and save myself hundreds of hours a year simply because I can do tings very quickly that take someone unfamiliar with those
tools much longer.  I am pretty good at VIM, and pretty good a regular expressions (though definitely not a master in either)
